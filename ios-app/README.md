# iOS Client for First Program

This folder contains a basic SwiftUI application that can communicate with the existing Flask backend. It provides a skeleton implementation of login, todo list, and forum features.

## Building

Open the folder in Xcode and create a new project using the existing Swift files. Configure the `baseURL` in `ApiService.swift` to point to your deployed backend.

Run the project on an iOS device or simulator.
